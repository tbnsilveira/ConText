# ConText
This project is about a **Context classification tool for natural language processing based on vector representation of words (word2vec) with non-supervised clustering algorithm k-means**. 

* This project research resulted in a paper presented at [Computer On The Beach 2018](https://siaiap32.univali.br/seer/index.php/acotb/article/view/12809) conference. 

* The algorithms were developed in a **deep learning** context, using GPUs for their processing.

* This project repository is beeing updated. The codes will be available soon.
